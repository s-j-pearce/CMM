# CMM (Capability Maturity Model)
The capability maturity model is a methodology which is used to develop and refine an organization's software develolment process. The model itself describes a five-level evolutionary path of increaingly organized and systematically more mature processes. CMM was developed and is promoted by the Software engineering institue, a research and development centre sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defence. SEI was established to optimize the process of developing, accuiring and maintaining heavily software-reliant systems for the D.o.D. Because the processes involved are equally applicable to the software industry as a whole, SEI advocates industry-wide adoption of the CMM.
### Five Levels of CMM
1. Initial level - The processes are disorganized and chaotic. Success is likely to depend on individual efforts alone, and is not considered to be repeatable, This is because the processes would not be sufficiently defined and documented to allow them to be replicated.

2. Repeatable level - Very basic project management techniques are established, Successes could possibly be repeated because the requisite processes would have been made established, defined, and documented.

3. Defined level - An organization would have developed its own standard of software process through greater attention to detail within documentation, standardization, and integration.

4. Managed level - An organization monitors and controls its own processes through data collection and analysis.

5. Optimizing level - Processes are constantly being improved through monitored feedback from current processes and introducing innovative processes to better serve the organization's particular needs.
